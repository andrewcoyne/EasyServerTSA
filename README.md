# EasyServerTSA
An easily configured server for hosting simple websites.

This project was created specifically for the TSA Software Development competition (2018-2019).

This program is for those who are learning HTML, JavaScript, etc. and want to host their own website.

NOTE: Required files include "index.html", "404.html", and "not_supported.html"

The folder "Demo Files" contains everything needed to use EasyServer. The folder "Demo Files 2" contains only "index.html" because the folder is meant for testing whether or not the program will launch a server without all required files.
